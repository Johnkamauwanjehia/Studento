## The only app you need for acing your IGCSE!

This app is a WIP, but here's a small description of what's to come:

#### Past Papers
-  Studento allows you to access O Level and A Level past papers & marking
   schemes offline(after the first run). There is no more need to browse through
   websites and remember complicated codes so you can get the right paper. You
   can consistently keep track of the papers you've completed and how many marks
   you've earned on each of them.

#### A solid schedule
- Store and easily check your daily schedule, keep track of important events
  through your calendar & oh, add notifications for your next text/exam!
  Possibly the best way to get rid of surprise tests in the morning ;)

#### Keeping track of homework- the smart way
- A virtual to-do list so you can easily note down homework(...and remember it
   later!)

#### Revisions notes that you can count on
- A compilation of high quality revisions notes on each subject so you can catch
  up on classes you missed, or master topics that have been giving you trouble.
